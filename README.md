### What I learned

The most challenging part of this project was making the hamburger menu for the mobile version but after doing some research and some trial and error I managed to make a good looking menu with some smooth transitions.

### Useful resources

- [Multiple hamburger menu pen](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/RwLGjKq) - This pen helped me a lot to get an idea of how to make the hamburger menu. Big thaks to [Álvaro](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo) for making it.
